This repository showcases a Java-based solution for simulating forensic 3D imaging use cases. The core functionality revolves around capturing, displaying, and analyzing forensic images, which are modeled using a class hierarchy:

Imaging (base class) handles image capturing and displaying.
Imaging3D extends the base class to add 3D image depth.
Forensic3DImaging adds specific forensic analysis features.

The code demonstrates inheritance, method overriding, and encapsulation in object-oriented programming (OOP) to represent the complexities of forensic imaging in a simplified manner. This can be useful for applications in law enforcement or medical imaging contexts where 3D analysis is essential for crime scene investigation.
